flexagon theory</b></font> </p>

<p><b>Introduction</b> </p>

<p>This is a rather rough and ready approach to how flexagons
work. I've read the paper by Oakley and Wisner (1957) and to be
honest it uses too much jargon for me to understand.</p>

<p>It was basically easier to work out for myself most of what
follows. Please excuse my hand-drawn sketches, but this is only
an interest for me, and I've lots of other things to do.. ;).
I've recently expanded the page, after a couple of people
contacted me with ideas, but there's still more work to do.
Nevertheless, it's a good start.... </p>

<p>I guess many people reading this will be connecting via a
modem and telephone line, and you'll no doubt want to read this
stuff offline. Because there are a load of gif pictures as well
as text, to make things easier I've made a zipped up file of
theory discussion and gif pictures. </p>

<p>This file can be downloaded by clicking <a href="theory.zip">*****here*****</a>
( 140kB ) </p>

<p>Alternatively, to look at the next page right now, click <a
href="theory1.html">*****here*****</a> </p>

<p>Any feedback will be greeted with interest and courtesy. About
one in fifteen visitors to my flexagon site make it to the
theory, so consider yourself one of the select and intelligent
few. That means you might be able to help me out. I've had some
excellent, enjoyable and helpful discussions with clever people
reading this stuff; do join them.... </p>
