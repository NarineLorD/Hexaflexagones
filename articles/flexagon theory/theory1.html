flexagon theory</b></font> </p>

<p><b>Trihexaflexagon</b> </p>

<p>Trihexa- is made from a straight strip of 6 triangles which
joins onto itself. It's the simplest flexing flexagon. </p>

<p>There are actually two sorts, which you might call left and
right handed, depending on whether (while making it) you wind the
strip of triangles over or under itself: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="f2.gif" width="200" height="160"> <img
src="f1.gif" width="200" height="160"></p>

<p align="left">We'll define the operation of flexing as ...
well, flexing - that is, pinching at one corner and pushing the
opposite corner in, opening the flexagon out again from the
middle to reveal a new face. </p>

<p>The operation of flexing produces the same result for both
left and right handed sorts of flexagons - it's just that the
triangles move in different directions (clockwise v
anticlockwise) around the hexagon. You can come back here later
and check this out once we've talked about the flexing operation
in more depth. </p>

<p>Thus we need only consider the flexagon shown on the right -
the other is equivalent. </p>

<p>What happens when we flex the flexagon? Let's pinch the crease
shown with the arrow here, and flex.. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="flx.gif" width="600" height="200"> </p>

<p align="left">Look at the 3 triangles x, y, z. After the flex,
x is under y. Check out exactly what happens, and convince
yourself that exactly the same thing must happen to the triangles
in each third of the flexagon - in other words in the following
diagram x1, y1, z1 are exactly the same as x2, y2, z2 and as x3,
y3, z3: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="xyz.gif" width="180" height="160"> </p>

<p align="left">When we look at more complicated flexagons, we
see that instead of 3 triangles x, y, z we have a more
complicated structure; but whatever the structure, if the
flexagon is to flex to reveal all its faces (if there are no
redundant triangles whose faces don't ever get seen), then we can
divide the flexagon into 3 identical parts in the same way (ie 2
triangles faces in each part). </p>

<p>We can therefore analyse just 2 triangles, and triplicate them
at the end. We'll look at the two triangles shown as x and z,y in
the diagram above. </p>

<p><b>Pats</b> </p>

<p>It's going to be confusing talking about triangles, because
there are triangles in the unfolded strip, and also triangles on
the hexagon face of the flexagon. Therefore, I'm now going to
call the triangles on the hexagon face (that is, for example, 'x'
and 'z,y' above) 'pats'. This term is used in the Oakley and
Wisner paper. There are 6 pats on the face of a hexaflexagon.
Each pat can consist of a lot of triangles folded up, with of
course only the top one showing. </p>

<p>We can label the six pats with Roman numerals I, II, III, IV,
V, VI, going anticlockwise: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="6pats.gif" width="200" height="160"> </p>

<p align="left">We only need consider pats I and II at this
stage. </p>

<p>We can label the corners of each pat, and each triangle within
the pat, with the letters a, b, c, as shown. </p>

<p><b>Operations on a simple flexagon</b> </p>

<p>Taking our two pats again, and labelling them I and II, we
have: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="2pats.gif" width="200" height="130"> </p>

<p align="left">There are two operations to consider at first -
flexing and rotating. We'll do all our flexing by pinching at the
East crease (arrowed) and rotating the flexagon when necessary. </p>

<p><u>Flexing</u> </p>

<p>We'll represent the pats by using the notation I; II<sub>i</sub>,
II<sub>ii</sub>. This means that the left hand pat consists of
just I, and the right hand pat has two components - II<sub>i</sub>
on top, and (joining on the top edge ready for flexing) II<sub>ii</sub>
on the bottom. </p>

<p>We can put a suffix a, b or c to indicate which corner is in
the centre of the flexagon. </p>

<p>The flex operation can be represented by: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="flx-rep.gif" width="232" height="39">
</p>

<p align="left">The bar across the top of a symbol means that
this bit has been turned over. </p>

<p><u>Rotation</u> </p>

<p>A flexagon is effectively invariant when rotated by a third of
a turn (we just get another two pats to look at which are the
same as the two we just had). </p>

<p>To reveal all the faces of a flexagon, sometimes we need to
rotate by a sixth of a turn. It doesn't matter which direction we
rotate - the result is always that the two pats I and II are in
effect interchanged: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="rot-rep.gif" width="146" height="33">
</p>

<p align="left">When I talk about rotating hereafter, I'll mean
rotating by a sixth of a turn. </p>

<p><b>Cycling through a trihexa-</b> </p>

<p>We can cycle through all the faces of a trihexa- by
alternatively flexing and rotating. This can be represented thus:
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="cycle.gif" width="187" height="329"> </p>

<p align="left">We have returned to the starting position, and
all three faces have been displayed. </p>

<p>We'll see in a moment how we can make I and II<sub>i</sub>, II<sub>ii</sub>
more complex (made of more than one triangle), and how this allow
us to reveal more than 3 faces. However for the time being, note
that even if I and II<sub>i</sub>, II<sub>ii</sub> contain
multiple triangles, we can still flex through this trihexa- cycle
and get to the start after 3 flexes and 3 rotations (just imagine
the extra triangles glued together). </p>

<p><b>More complex flexagons</b> </p>

<p>Taking any flexagon, we can see that if a flex is possible, we
must be able to write the pat as, eg II<sub>i</sub>, II<sub>ii</sub>
with the comma indicating the place where II<sub>i</sub> and II<sub>ii</sub>
join on the top edge. This join can only be one thickness of
paper, because the flex operation cannot untangle a double
thickness of paper (nor of course can the rotate operation). If
the pat II<sub>i</sub>, II<sub>ii</sub> is made of many
triangles, those triangles must have started in a strip form,
possible crooked, but never forking - again because neither flex
nor rotation operation can untangle a forked strip. </p>

<p>Thus we can see that the pat II<sub>i</sub>, II<sub>ii</sub>
is made from a strip of triangles, with II<sub>i</sub> being made
from the triangles at one end of the strip, and II<sub>ii</sub>
being made from the triangles at the other end of the strip. </p>

<p>We know that any flexagon can go through the trihexa- cycle to
reveal 3 faces in order, again and again. To make flexagons with
more than 3 faces we have to be able to flex in a different
place. If our two pats are I; II<sub>i</sub>, II<sub>ii</sub> we
know we can flex; and furthermore we can only flex in one way
because II<sub>i</sub>, II<sub>ii</sub> are joined by a single
thickness of paper. So the only way to flex to reveal more than 3
faces is to flex instead of rotating during our trihexa- cycle. </p>

<p>There are 3 places in the cycle where we rotate. Let's take
the first: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="rot1.gif" width="112" height="40"> </p>

<p align="left">If we are to flex here, then the pat </p>

<p align="center"><img src="ii.gif" width="49" height="33"> </p>

<p align="left">must have the form </p>

<p align="center"><img src="iia.gif" width="109" height="44"> </p>

<p align="left">in other words, be in two parts, joined at the
top edge. </p>

<p>We're going to examine more complex flexagons by starting with
a trihexa- and looking at what we have to do to increase the
number of possible faces. The operation to generate another face
here is: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="rc-op.gif" width="340" height="110"> </p>

<p align="left">which is the division of the pat (in this case a
single triangle) into two parts (in this case both being single
triangles). The original pat was part of a strip, and now the
strip has expanded, with the addition of a triangle: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="rc-strip.gif" width="315"
height="150"> </p>

<p align="left">Note that the upper part of the strip in this
diagram has been turned over, or reflected, by the operation. </p>

<p>After months (all right then - seconds) of deliberation, I
have decided to call this operation (to add a new face to the
flexagon) 'reflecto-cloning'. OK, it's not very pretty, but
what's in a name? </p>

<p>Notice that once we have reflecto-cloned a triangle, both
resulting triangles will present themselves for a further
possibility of a reflecto-clone - the upper one after a single
flex, and the lower after a further rotation and flex (check the
diagram for the trihexa- cycle). </p>

<p>The reflecto-clone operation is the same whenever on the
trihexa- cycle it is carried out. </p>

<p><b>Joining the flexagon strips together</b> </p>

<p>We have been looking at 2 pats, out of the 6 that make up a
flexagon. In a trihexa-, these 2 pats are made from a strip: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="tristrip1.gif" width="160"
height="145"> </p>

<p align="left">The dashed edges show joins to other pats. </p>

<p>We need 3 of these mini-strips to make the full flexagon. How
do they join together? Each mini-strip when assembled has the top
triangle folded over, and thus when joining the second mini-strip
to the first, we must turn the second strip over: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="tristrip2.gif" width="160"
height="145"> </p>

<p align="left">Similarly we turn over the third mini-strip again
(twice turned over, or the same as the first mini-strip). The
resulting compound strip is: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="tristrip3.gif" width="270"
height="330"> </p>

<p align="left">Note I've not shown any additional tabs for
glueing - I just assume you'll join the 2 dashed edges together
somehow. </p>

<p>When we join the mini-strips for flexagons with four faces
together, we note that the reflecto-clone operation introduced a
second fold, and hence there is no need to turn over the middle
mini-strip. </p>

<p>With 5 faces, we must again turn over the middle mini-strip;
with 6 we don't, with 7 we do, and so on. </p>

<p>As an aside, notice that all flexagons are Moebius bands -
i.e. they have only one 'side', and only one 'edge'. Because of
this, every face will eventually appear on both sides of the
flexagon. Also notice that trihexa- has one twist per mini-strip,
tetrahexa- has two, pentahexa- has three, and so on. </p>

<p><b>More on reflecto-cloning</b> </p>

<p>Taking the trihexa- mini-strip, and examining the trihexa-
cycle, there are 3 places a reflecto-clone can be carried out (on
each of the 3 triangles). The thick line shows the line of
reflection: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="rc3.gif" width="430" height="525"> </p>

<p align="left">You can check, if you wish, that the
reflecto-clone operation is the same for each case. No matter
where you reflecto-clone, the operation reflects along the edge
of the triangle that does not join to any other triangles (ie the
edge that lies on the edge of the strip), adding a new triangle
in the process. </p>

<p>All reflecto-clones must do this, as the join between 2
triangles forming a flex-able pat (eg IIi, IIii ) following a
reflecto-clone must be on the outside edge of the flexagon face. </p>

<p>Furthemore, any triangle that has an edge that lies on the
edge of the strip can be reflecto-cloned, because the 3 original
triangles in the trihexa- strip can all be reflecto-cloned, and
we have seen that any triangles resulting from a reflecto-clone
can themselves be reflecto-cloned. </p>

<p>You are probably wishing by now that I can chosen a prettier
name for that operation... Well, if you're not, I certainly am. </p>

<p>Anyway, we have now got away from considering the 3-D form of
the flexagon, and can confine ourselves to the 2-D strip. This is
a lot easier on the brain. </p>

<p><b>Making new flexagons</b> </p>

<p>We have already joined 3 mini-strips to make a trihexa-. </p>

<p>We generated 3 possible mini-strips to make a tetrahexa- (4
faces). These join together (the middle mini-strip doesn't turn
over) as follows: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="tetrastrip.gif" width="504"
height="478"> </p>

<p align="left">We can look at each of these strips as just one
continuous strip when assembled as a flexagon. They are both
therefore equivalent. In fact there was no need to look at 3
reflecto-clones, because of the symmetry of the trihexa-. </p>

<p>To make a pentahexa- (5 faces), we'll take a mini-strip from
the tetrahexa-. Any mini-strip will do, as they are all
equivalent. The possible reflecto-clones are: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="pentamini.gif" width="550"
height="680"> </p>

<p align="left">The strip which results from three of these being
joined (middle one turned over) is: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="pentastrip.gif" width="448"
height="236"> </p>

<p align="left">Joining 3 of any of the pentahexa- mini-strips
results in a strip which is equivalent to this (try it for
yourself). There is only one way to make a strip for the
pentahexa-, the tetrahexa-, and the trihexa-. </p>

<p>To make a hexahexa- (6 faces), we again take one of the
mini-strips from the pentahexa- (any will do, they're all
equivalent). I'm not going through all the possibilities here -
there are two more than I've shown, but the mini-strips are
equivalent to those here. The 3 different mini-strips can be
derived thus: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="hexamini.gif" width="522"
height="714"> </p>

<p align="left">When you join these together, you find there are
3 different strips from which you can make a hexahexaflexagon;
one is a straight strip, and the other two are: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="hexastrip.gif" width="408"
height="591"> </p>

<p align="left"><b>Further flexagons</b> </p>

<p>You now have a blueprint that allows you to make a flexagon of
any size. I'm not going any further here, but there are 4 types
for the heptahexa-, 12 for the octahexa-, 27 for the nonahexa-
and 82 for the decahexa-. </p>

<p>It is rather nice to note that if we start with a trihexa- and
do a reverse-reflecto-clone, we end up with an ordinary hexagon.
Put another way, take the mini-strip for an ordinary hexagon, and
reflecto-clone it: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="duomini.gif" width="313" height="138">
</p>

<p align="left">We get the mini-strip for a trihexa-. </p>

<p>That certainly has a pleasing elegance to my mind :) </p>

<p>Note that reverse-reflecto-cloning the hexagon gives us
something like this: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="unohex.gif" width="129" height="122">
</p>

<p align="left">It could be said to have 6 triangles (3 triangles
with 2 sides each) making up a single hexagon face, but I think
we're pushing it into hyperspace a bit too far here. </p>

<p><b>Help, help... how do I fold my flexagon strip?</b> </p>

<p>Every time you do a reflecto-clone, label the line of
reflection with consecutive numbers, starting with a hexagon. For
instance: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="numbers.gif" width="466" height="330">
</p>

<p align="left">Now work backwards, folding at the highest number
first (3 in this case). This works because you are just reversing
what you did when you reflecto-cloned. </p>

<p>The operation of flexing always involves a twist (the
direction depends on whether you have a left-handed or
right-handed flexagon). Each flex twists in the same direction.
You must therefore fold your strip to impart the same direction
twist at each fold. The best way is to do this is to hold the end
triangle (that'll be part or all of pat I) in your left hand, and
always fold in an anticlockwise (or clockwise if you wish)
direction. </p>

<p><b>State Diagrams</b> </p>

<p>The sequence of 'flex at one corner until you get stuck, then
rotate; repeat' is known as the Tuckerman traverse (Tuckerman
invented it). </p>

<p>On my original page (July 1998), I wrote: </p>

<p>&quot;You can see that the pattern of reflecto-clones
determines the behaviour of the flexagon under the normal
operations of flexing and rotation. No doubt there is a pretty
way to put this into a formula - anyone fancy a crack at
it?&quot;</p>

<p>Well, <a href="mailto:rsholmes@mailbox.syr.edu">Rich Holmes
rsholmes@mailbox.syr.edu</a> wrote to me and said (paraphrased),
'I expect you know all this already but when you graph the
Tuckerman traverse, you find that each node of the graph is a
vertex of one or more triangles. The trihexa is a single
triangle; the tetrahexa is a pair of triangles with a vertex in
common; the pentahexa is three triangles, one sharing a vertex
with each of the other two. And so on; each reflectoclone
corresponding to the addition of a new triangle to the old graph.
If you collapse each triangle down to a node, you get a graph
with n-2 nodes (n being the number of faces in the flexagon)
which can be drawn on a hexagonal array.' </p>

<p>I had to admit that I wished I had 'known all that already';
Rich and I then had a brief but enjoyable time working on it - it
goes like this: </p>

<p>We can label any face of the flexagon thus:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="face.gif" width="254" height="205"></p>

<p align="left">where the arrow shows the place to pinch if you
are about to try to flex. If you <u>can</u> flex, all the corners
labelled b end up in the centre (we showed this above). We can
label not just the top face of the flexagon with a,b,c but all
faces in all pats (so imagine the flexagon is made of blotting
paper and the ink has run through to the reverse side). The
corners thus labelled always stay together during flexes - there
is is no way to flex (or rotate of course) which changes this. It
doesn't matter how thick the pats are.</p>

<p align="left">It's now time for you to get out your mini-strip
again, and see what happens during a flex. Let us say that we
have a trihexa- labelled as above. The top face is labelled 1,
and we are able to flex it. We will describe this orientation as
1<sub>abc</sub> (counting the corners of the middle top triangle
anticlockwise from the centre).</p>

<p align="left">We flex, and we label the next face to appear 2.
Check its orientation - it is 2<sub>bac</sub>. We rotate, to
orientation 2<sub>bca</sub>. A further flex gives us 3<sub>cba</sub>,
and a rotate 3<sub>cab</sub>. Flexing now gives 1<sub>acb</sub>,
and a final rotate takes us back to 1<sub>abc</sub>.</p>

<p align="left">Any rotate keeps the same 'first' corner (in the
centre) and interchanges the other two subscripts - eg 1<sub>acb</sub>
goes to 1<sub>abc</sub>.</p>

<p align="left">Any flex gives a different face, and it keeps the
same 'final' corner and interchanges the other two subscripts -
eg 1<sub>abc </sub>goes to 2<sub>bac</sub>.</p>

<p align="left">We can plot the faces appearing on a state
diagram; I've ignored the last two suffixes of the orientation
here for ease - it's still the same face, however you rotate it:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="state3.gif" width="125" height="105"></p>

<p>So much for the top face; what about the face underneath?
Well, we know that it will have the same corner in the centre as
the face on top. The face number will be the number of the face
that was on the top before the last flex. Therefore, if we use
the notation 'top/bottom' to show the top and bottom faces, we
have:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="state3a.gif" width="125" height="105"></p>

<p>It's quite nice to look at this from the perspective of an ant
- he is at a corner of the triangle, he rotates (himself and the
flexagon) and then marches forward while flexing. At the corner
he rotates again, then marches forward flexing.</p>

<p>What happens if he marches forward from face 3c, but rather
than rotating he marches straight on? Yes, when he first arrives
at face 1a, there is a single thickness of paper in the middle
top pat, and you can perform a reflectoclone. Thus he can march
straight on with another flex to reveal the new face 4.</p>

<p>You can now imagine that all the triangles in the other pat
(you one you did not reflectoclone) are stuck together with glue
for a moment. You still have a trihexa-, and a triangular state
diagram. The sequence goes:</p>

<p>1<sub>acb</sub> flex to 4<sub>cab</sub> rotate to 4<sub>cba</sub>
flex to 3<sub>bca</sub> rotate to 3<sub>bac</sub> flex to 1<sub>abc</sub>
and rotate to 1<sub>acb</sub> again. We can now unstick the glued
triangles, and make a complete state diagram, including the
bottom faces:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="state4.gif" width="205" height="164"></p>

<p>As an aside, you could have predicted that the missing top
face in the new triangle of the state diagram was going to be 3,
because that face after a flex would be on the bottom under 1<sub>a</sub>.</p>

<p>Notice that the direction of travel round the two triangles is
not the same. In fact, Rich Holmes' version of this does have
travel round every triangle the same way. If you say we always
travel anticlockwise around the triangles, we have:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="state4a.gif" width="205" height="164"></p>

<p>We escape from a triangle by choosing the right-most path.
There are advantages for both methods I think. Both methods can
fit the triangles onto the same grid, but in the first method
this is a necessary consequence, whereas with the second it is
merely convenient. However when we come to talk about mirror
images a bit later, the second method might be easier.</p>

<p>I'll therefore now use the second method - always going
anticlockwise around triangles.</p>

<p>We can expand the analysis further. At any spare corner of the
state diagram, we can reflectoclone to add a new triangle and new
face. This new face will be the first to appear, after the ant
leaves the old state diagram. The orientations of the faces can
be determined by considering what happens as the ant performs a
series of flexes, without rotating (that is, taking the
right-most path). Each flex interchanges the first two subscripts
of the orientation, so the ant taking the right-most path will
see alternating orientations - for instance a, c, a, c, a, c,
a,.... This means straight lines in the state diagram read
a,b,c,a,b,c..... (in the direction of flexing in the original
triangle). (Note you can't actually travel down one of these
straight lines). Orientations a,b and c appear in each triangle
(alternating anticlockwise and clockwise).</p>

<p align="center"><img src="abc.gif" width="375" height="308"></p>

<p>Here's an example - the state diagram for one of the
heptahexa-s. Here I've put the arrows on the sides of the
triangles. New faces are labelled as they appear on the Tuckerman
traverse. Where two arrows point in towards the same state, the
underneath face in the middle was previously the top face:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="state7.gif" width="290" height="290"></p>

<p>Notice that you can reflectoclone so that the state diagram
curves back round on itself:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="round.gif" width="229" height="240"></p>

<p>Here we started with the top triangle, and worked round adding
triangles in a clockwise direction. The latest triangle to add
(the dotted one) appears to overlap - but it does <u>not</u> join
onto the original triangle; rather, it starts a new layer, which
can itself expand in any direction. Pretty though, isn't it?</p>

<p>Here's one Rich calls 'linear':</p>

<p align="center"><img src="linear.gif" width="508" height="145"></p>

<p>If you follow the Tuckerman traverse around it, one face
appears again and again (face 3 in this example). Face 3 also
appears on the under side repeatedly (under face 1, 5, 7, 9...)</p>

<p>The Tuckerman traverse can be restated as 'keep taking the
right-most path'. It returns to the start having marched down
each side of each triangle once and once only. It is therefore
the quickest way to visit every face. It is also the uniquely
quickest way to visit every face - any other path would mean
marching over a triangle side twice. One way to look at this is
to imagine we've found the quickest way around some flexagon; we
now reflectoclone to add a face - the unique quickest way round
the new triangle on the state diagram is using the Tuckerman
traverse; and all flexagons can be grown from a trihexa- by
reflectocloning.</p>

<p>If we replace each triangle with a dot, we have a hexagonal
grid on which we can plot the state diagrams:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="grid.gif" width="220" height="216"></p>

<p>It expands in all directions, of course, and overlaps itself
as necessary.</p>

<p>We now know how to draw any state diagram, and build a
flexagon from it by using reflectocloning. Or vice versa.</p>

<p>So, how many unique flexagons are there of a particular order
(that is, having a particular number of faces)?</p>

<p>Trihexa- is just a dot. Tetrahexa- is 2 dots joined by a line.
Pentahexa- is 3 dots joined by lines:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="345.gif" width="238" height="90"></p>

<p>Obviously there is just one of each. Here are the 3
hexahexa-s:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="6.gif" width="355" height="121"></p>

<p>You can work out others for yourself if you wish.</p>

<p>At this point in stepped <a href="mailto:acmq@coe.ufrj.br">Antonio
Carlos M. de Queiroz acmq@coe.ufrj.br</a> from Brazil, who said
(paraphrased), 'I worked on all this ~20 years ago, and I
developed a simple method to find how many different forms are
possible, a method to classify them, and a method to find how to
make and fold any flexagon.'</p>

<p>His build technique, which he describes as 'top down', goes
like this: </p>

<p>Decide the state diagram of the flexagon you'd like to make. </p>

<p>Now build a flexagon from a straight strip of sufficient size
so that the target state diagram fits.</p>

<p>Flex your flexagon accordingly to the state diagram you have
chosen; whenever the flexagon reaches a corner on the state
diagram, make sure that there is only one thickness of paper in
the middle top pat. If there is more than one, glue them
together! (Of course you must do the same to the 2 other
identical pats - the flexagon is made of 3 ministrips).</p>

<p>Carefully unwind your flexagon, and voilá, there you have it.
</p>

<p>Now to the classification. You'll like this...</p>

<p>Label each free corner on the state diagram with a 0, and each
corner which is common to two triangles with a 1. Now count out
the numbers as you march around the Tuckerman traverse.</p>

<p>With a trihexa- you get 000. With a tetrahexa- you get 001001.
With a pentahexa- you get 001010011. And so on.</p>

<p>These are 'circular' numbers - they don't start or end
anywhere - you can 'rotate' them without changing the flexagon,
because that is just starting your flexing at a different face.
So tetrahexa- could be restated as 010010 or 100100, for example.
You can therefore classify the flexagon by choosing the maximum
(or minimum) binary number possible by 'rotating'.</p>

<p>Using maxima,which is Antonio's method, we have:</p>

<p>Trihexa- = 000; tetrahexa- = 100100; pentahexa- = 110010100;
etc..</p>

<p>I personally prefer minima:</p>

<p>Trihexa- = 000; tetrahexa- = 001001; pentahexa- = 001010011;</p>

<p>These numbers can be generated by replacing any 0 in the
preceding flexagon with 1001 - that is the same as
reflectocloning at a free corner. Antonio wrote a program all
those years ago (in Algol, would you believe?) to systematically
replace the 0's and find the maxima; the program checked for
duplicates and was therefore able to print out classifications
for all the distinct varieties of flexagon of a particular order.</p>

<p>He's just rewritten his program in C - and intends to use it
to print out state diagrams graphically. At the time of writing,
he's just uploaded his original sketches - have a look at his
pages <a href="http://www.coe.ufrj.br/~acmq/hexaflexagons.html">http://www.coe.ufrj.br/~acmq/hexaflexagons.html</a>.</p>

<p>If you use the minima method, you can say a number of things
about the classification number. For instance it will always
start with 001 (except trihexa-), so we could omit this. It will
always contain 1001 somewhere (the last reflectoclone). It will
always end in 1. A maximum of two 0's can be together. The
maximum number of 1's together is (the number of faces - 3);
there is always one and only one flexagon of any order like this.</p>

<p>Antonio also points out that the binary number will be a
multiple of three long (because we replace a 0 with 1001 each
time), so we could use an octal representation. Thus using the
minima method and omitting the first octal digit (1 except for
trihexa-), we have:</p>

<p>trihexa- = 0; tetrahexa- = 1; pentahexa- = 23; hexahexa- =
247, 463, 515; etc...</p>

<p><strong>Mirror images</strong></p>

<p>Let's backtrack a bit and consider flexagon 515. Are there two
varieties? The state diagrams could be:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="6a.gif" width="283" height="87"></p>

<p>in other words, is the mirror image 313 a valid new flexagon? </p>

<p>If you build the two flexagons, you'll find that faces do come
up in a different order. But turn one flexagon over and flex on
the reverse side - the two flexagons are now identical! One way
to look at this is to consider a particular pat ready for a flex:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="reverse.gif" width="182" height="106"></p>

<p>The top face is P, the underneath face is R, and Q is about to
appear. Thus the sequence of flex, rotate, flex, rotate, flex,
rotate... will cycle through P, Q, R... But turn the flexagon
over, and the sequence is reversed (it looks exactly the same
except that R is now the top, and P the bottom). The sequence
runs R, Q, P...</p>

<p>This is a general result - it doesn't matter how complex the
pat is. The same thing applies to any adjacent pat which could be
flexed. We progress the opposite way around the state diagram if
we turn over the flexagon. This equivalent to the mirror image of
the state diagram, because to get to that mirror image, we
reflect the state diagram:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="statec.gif" width="331" height="159"></p>

<p align="left">(which is just another way of drawing it - the
sequence is unchanged) and then we reverse the direction of
travel round triangles to make it anticlockwise again.</p>

<p align="left">Another issue worth looking at is what happens if
you take a strip ready for folding, and then reverse the
direction of every fold. If you go back to the very beginning of
this page, you'll find I've identified left and right handed
flexagons. These correspond to flexagons with their folds
reversed. Another way to look at this is to say the left and
right handed varieties arise from reflectocloning starting from
the left and right triangles of the ministrip for a hexagon. The
direction of folding is opposite for the two reflectoclone
starting points. All the same strips will arise as you carry on
reflectocloning, because the operation is the same, and there is
no difference between the two triangles of the ministrip for the
hexagon. For example:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="left-right.gif" width="465"
height="132"></p>

<p><strong>How many flexagons?</strong></p>

<p>Apparently in about 1976 Martin Gardner wrote an article in
which he mentions in passing:</p>

<p>&quot;If we .... ask in how many essentially different ways a
regular hexaflexagon of n faces can be made, the answer is
provided by a sequence that counts the triangulations of convex
polygons when rotations and reflections are excluded.&quot;</p>

<p>I've just found a way to map our state diagrams onto the
triangulated polygons, and I'm feeling quite pleased with myself
:). I will now reveal all...</p>

<p>Firstly what is a triangulated polygon? It's a polygon cut
into triangles by straight lines connecting it's corners.
Excluding rotations and reflections, there is one way to
triangulate a square, and one way to triangulate a pentagon:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="tp45.gif" width="380" height="159"></p>

<p>There are three ways to triangulate a hexagon:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="tp6.gif" width="475" height="173"></p>

<p align="left">and four ways to triangulate a heptagon:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="tp7.gif" width="440" height="352"></p>

<p align="left">Let's take the hexagon as an example; we can
superimpose our state diagram for the hexahexaflexagon to get:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="tp6a.gif" width="475" height="173"></p>

<p align="left">We need to show this will work in general for any
flexagon and polygon. Let's start with a triangle and put a dot
in it to represent the state diagram of a trihexa-. This will be
our base which we expand from. Reflectocloning adds another dot,
and another triangle. The resulting figure has four sides and can
be straightened up to a square:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="rt3.gif" width="434" height="116"></p>

<p>We have found all the triangulations of a square (just one of
course). Now we can reflectoclone again, adding another triangle
to the square. There are two places we can do it, but we don't
care which (for either the state diagram or the triangulation)
because they are mirror images. So:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="rt4.gif" width="303" height="162"></p>

<p>Each time we add another triangle, we add another face to the
polygon. Let's look at a general polygon with n sides. It can be
said to be made up of a polygon of n-1 sides, with a triangle
added onto the sides (I'll show this in a moment). If we know all
the unique ways to triangulate the n-1 sided polygon, we can find
all the unique ways to triangulate the n sided polygon, just by
adding on the triangle to each face (for each of the previous
triangulations). Perhaps some of these extra triangles will not
result in unique triangulations due to rotation or reflection,
but neither will they result in unique flexagon state diagrams.</p>

<p>So, we can start with a triangle (one way to triangulate -
itself), and progress to a square, then a pentagon, and so on -
as far as we like.</p>

<p>To show that a triangulated n-sided polygon must be made of a
triangle added onto a n-1 sided polygon, choose any line between
corners of the polygon. This must be the base of some triangle,
whose apex must be one of the adjacent corners. Draw this
triangle; you now have a new base of a new triangle. Continue
until you run out of corners; the last line you draw creates a
triangle with two sides in common with the polygon - remove it
and you have a polygon with n-1 sides.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="rtn.gif" width="190" height="139"></p>

<p>Notice if you start with the same line across the polygon and
work in the other direction, you end up with another triangle,
which we can regard as our first starting triangle of the
trihexa-.</p>

<p>So we have successfully shown that the number of distinct
flexagons of order n is the same as the number of distinct ways
to triangulate a polygon with n sides.</p>

<p>Therefore we don't need to worry about heavy maths and
horrible formulae because someone already did all that. I never
need to struggle with that Oakley and Wisner paper again :)</p>

<p>We are talking 'Catalan' numbers here; the n<sup>th</sup>
Catalan number apparently gives the number of ways a convex
polygon with n+2 sides can be triangulated (including reflections
and rotations). This relates to the number of flexagons
(including reflections and rotations). The sequence goes:</p>

<p>1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, 16796...</p>

<p>The formula is: <img src="catalaneq.gif" align="middle"
width="40" height="51"></p>

<p>If we exclude reflections and rotations we get:</p>

<p>1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 12, 27, 82, 228, 733, 2282, 7528...</p>

<p>I haven't found anywhere that tells me the formula for this
one yet - if you find one, or know it, let me know (please!).
It's a standard thing I think.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>How many unique strips?</strong></p>

<p align="left">Some different flexagons are made from the same
strip by folding differently. So how many unique strips are
there?</p>

<p align="left">I've not found a way to get a formula for this as
yet, but you can use a progressive computer technique similar to
Antonio's, to automatically print out the results. I've not done
this, but the idea is as follows:</p>

<p align="left">We can code a ministrip, by starting at the base
triangle and (like our ant) walking along it. If we have to turn
left to get to the next triangle, we call out 0, if right we call
out 1. For example, a hexagon is 11, a trihexa- 101, a tetrahexa-
1100</p>

<p align="left">We can generate ministrips by reflectocloning.
So, we take a general ministrip q,r,s for flexagon order n, where
q and s are a series of 0s and 1s together, and r is a single 0
or 1. We reflectoclone at r and get a new number for the
ministrip which is q,(inverse of r),r,(inverse of s). For example
q=10, r=1,s=101 q,r,s=101101 after the reflectcoclone the new
ministrip is 10,0,1,010 =1001010.</p>

<p align="left">We combine 3 ministrips into the complete strip,
remembering to turn over (invert) the middle one if necessary.
Then we consider all the possible one thirds of the whole strip
(ministrips) (and their inversions, because we can turn the strip
over) and look for a maximum. So for ministrip 1001010, which is
a flexagon of order 7, the entire strip is
1001010,0110101,1001010. The first third to consider is 1001010
with it's inversion 0110101. We choose the maximum 1001010. The
next third to look at is 0010100, with it's inversion 1101011.
1101011 is larger than 1001010 so we choose that. And so on
through the strip. The final maximum is the classification for
that ministrip.</p>

<p align="left">The whole technique, then, is to start with the
ministrip classification for a hexagon, reflectoclone to get all
the ministrips for the next flexagon, classify them and eliminate
duplicates; print them out; repeat.</p>

<p align="left">It would be nice to have a formula though......</p>

<p align="left"><strong>The End</strong></p>

<p>If you got here I congratulate you.</p>

<p>I've had some really interesting people write to me recently
about this stuff, and I'm very grateful to them; it's also a lot
of fun sharing ideas. So, please feel free to get in touch,
especially if you can contribute. All help is most welcome :).</p>
